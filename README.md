# Wine Quality Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning model that predicts the quality of wines based on various features. The model is developed using Python and scikit-learn library.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the "Wine Quality" dataset, which provides information about the physicochemical properties of wines. The dataset is divided into two versions: red wine and white wine. You can choose the dataset version that suits your needs.

Please use the dataset of your choice and place it in the repository folder before running the model.

## Model Development

The machine learning model is implemented using the Google colab. You can find the code and detailed explanation in the following file:

- [Model Development Notebook](DevTown_Assignment.ipynb)

In the notebook, you will find step-by-step instructions on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The code is well-commented to facilitate understanding, especially for beginners.

## Explanation Video

To provide a visual explanation of the model and its implementation, we have created an explanation video. The video covers the key concepts, code walkthrough, and insights gained from the model.
